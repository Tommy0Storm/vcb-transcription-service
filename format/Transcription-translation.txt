So, um, should the Okay, so, um, yes, because 1.1, what does it?

Should the above be completed so my my eyes are terrible.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:12]
Um should the above project not be completed could be terminated before the termination date referred to by the part of terminate on such earlier completion.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:19]
Okay.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:20]
How how does this contract differ from her her um final sign contract?

SPEAKER 2 [00:00:27]
Uh, define what sense.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:29]
So the key I saw.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:32]
contract, contract.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:36]
Sorry, you broke up there.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:38]
Okay, the limited duration contract that you testified to earlier, I think it's extra 5.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:44]
Um, remember the limited duration contract that she entered into um with pertaining to this exact date, the 30th of April 2024?

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:52]
Did the class differ much from from that from that agreement?

SPEAKER 2 [00:00:58]
Um, it had the same clauses that stated that it was for a limited time for a limited, um, period.

SPEAKER 2 [00:01:48]
I'm not sure I understand um, I'm not sure I understand the question completely because the how it differed was obviously it was um a change to our KPIs.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:01]
No, if you go to paragraph, if you go then to down to page um if you go down then to page 391,

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:08]
391.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:11]
Yes, please.

SPEAKER 2 [00:02:13]
Uh, let me find it.

SPEAKER 2 [00:02:18]
391.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:21]
Sorry it's a very last Yeah.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:23]
I'm going there now.

SPEAKER 2 [00:02:27]
Uh, I don't have 391, I have 321.

SPEAKER 2 [00:02:31]
321.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:32]
I just double check.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:33]
Sorry.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:33]
Um I just want to see I've got this bundle of mine is very strange.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:37]
Hold on, let me just get back to the um 3319, sorry.

SPEAKER 2 [00:03:22]
319.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:23]
319.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:25]
I think it's 319.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:25]
Yes.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:26]
So it's 319, not 391, 319.

SPEAKER 2 [00:03:29]
I've got it.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:31]
Okay, so um this is a um email that that you sent her regarding a um reminder.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:39]
Now you testified earlier regarding the reminder emails that you had to send her.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:43]
Can you just tell the commissioner what the relevance of this is, please?

SPEAKER 2 [00:03:46]
So this again was just reminding her that this is what was agreed to.

SPEAKER 2 [00:03:52]
Um also remember at this uh point in time we are still in discussions with our client about whether we would be continuing with them, if we'd still go through a building process.

SPEAKER 2 [00:04:02]
So at that point I cannot give anyone sort of an an inclination or hope that there would be anything that would might happen even though we were still um going through a process without client.

SPEAKER 1 [00:04:16]
Thank you.

SPEAKER 1 [00:04:17]
And then can we move on to page 320, please?

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:01]
Um 320.

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:06]
Uh yes, I'm here.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:09]
What is this document?

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:11]
Uh this is the applicants.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:16]
For what month?

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:18]
Uh.

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:22]
The for May, May 2024.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:31]
Okay, can you just please um explain to the commissioner how her travel allowance worked for for this month, for these months.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:39]
For for for May, sorry for May.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:41]
Could you just read additional travel, just read into the record what it says next to additional travel.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:45]
Sorry, additional travel, it says.

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:49]
Okay, so for the additional travel it says April, May and June.

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:52]
So what had happened with our new agreement with our client, they agreed to pay an additional um a fuel fuel allowance based on the submission of log books and and that it was to be used as a work as a working tool.

SPEAKER 2 [00:06:47]
Um what we had got them to agree to was to backdate it to go to start from April.

SPEAKER 2 [00:06:53]
So initially even though they didn't work in uh she didn't necessarily work for it in April, May and May prior to this point, our client had agreed to backdate it just to give them a little bit of a little bit of extra money.

SPEAKER 1 [00:07:10]
Okay, can you just explain to the commissioner how this fuel breakdown worked in terms of the additional fuel that was now paid and what was the agreed upon fuel?

SPEAKER 2 [00:07:17]
It was so so the agreed upon was the 3,000 as stated above, um on the same and then if you go um to the bottom for the for April, May, June, how it would be two it would be 2,000 rand additional every month.

SPEAKER 2 [00:07:35]
Again, provided that we sent them all of the correct documentation.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:20]
Right.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:24]
Sorry, you broke up there and the and the additional was?

SPEAKER 2 [00:08:27]
The additional is it so it covers three months, April, May and June, so it would mean that it would be 2,000 rand per month.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:36]
Okay.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:37]
Then um can you just please move to page 321, please?

SPEAKER 2 [00:08:43]
Um yes, I'm here.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:45]
Okay, and can you please explain uh just tell us what what the date is for this document?

SPEAKER 2 [00:08:50]
Um so this is for June.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:53]
Okay, and then if you go to travel allowance, fixed and cost.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:57]
Can you explain to the commissioner why because as I understand she was a she was she was she'd get the 3,000 and then she'd get a 2,000 additional on that, is that correct?

SPEAKER 2 [00:09:06]
Yeah.

SPEAKER 2 [00:09:07]
So if you go above to the previous that was in May, you'll see that we paid it for June already.

SPEAKER 1 [00:09:16]
Okay.

SPEAKER 1 [00:09:17]
So is that what she only got up 3,000 for that month, not 5,000?

SPEAKER 2 [00:10:01]
That is correct.

SPEAKER 1 [00:10:03]
Okay.

SPEAKER 1 [00:10:04]
Can and um Okay, thank you.

SPEAKER 1 [00:10:08]
That'll be uh testimony in chief.

SPEAKER 1 [00:10:10]
Thank you, madam Commissioner.

SPEAKER 2 [00:10:13]
Thank you.

SPEAKER 3 [00:10:44]
Uh sorry, I'm having a very wonderful discussion with myself.

SPEAKER 3 [00:10:47]
I've been muted.

SPEAKER 3 [00:10:49]
Okay.

SPEAKER 3 [00:10:50]
Um Mr., do you need a few minutes?

SPEAKER 4 [00:10:55]
Um, yes, Madam Commissioner, if you can just give me until 2 o'clock.

SPEAKER 3 [00:11:41]
Okay, perfect.

SPEAKER 4 [00:11:42]
I just just so I can just put everyone in the picture.

SPEAKER 4 [00:11:45]
I I am in discussion with the client whether we should resume the cross examination today, seeing that it's it's after 1 o'clock because I don't think I would be able to finish her evidence today, but I just want to take instructions from my client on that and and come back and give you a proper address on that issue.

SPEAKER 1 [00:12:05]
Thank you very much.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:07]
Okay.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:08]
Um what I can ask while you guys are discussing, um please can you look at dates again.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:19]
Um let me just check.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:22]
I am available.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:25]
Let me just see.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:27]
Um I'm doing training somewhere.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:32]
Let me just check.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:34]
Um Hang on one second.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:24]
I can tell you which dates I'm not available.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:34]
Okay, wait.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:34]
I'm doing training on the 20th and the 21st of November.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:42]
Okay?

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:43]
So I'm not available then.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:46]
But most of the other days I'm available.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:49]
I don't think I'm going to be doing anything.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:54]
So if you guys can so long check your diaries and then maybe I don't know if you would still be available in November or then we'll have to do it early um December before I go on leave.

SPEAKER 3 [00:14:10]
So check your diaries please, um and then we can go from there as well.

SPEAKER 4 [00:14:18]
Noted ma'am. Thank you.

SPEAKER 2 [00:15:00]
Thank you very much.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:06]
I I don't want to start this evidence and leave it in the middle.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:11]
Because it gives her a chance to go and go and figure out what's going on.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:18]
And I understand what you're saying like yes, but I'm definitely not going to finish.

SPEAKER 1 [00:15:25]
Okay.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:26]
And I'd like to keep a witness one day.

SPEAKER 3 [00:15:37]
Yo guys, I'm just I'm worried about the parties with regards to the um wasted time and wasted costs with regards to this.

SPEAKER 3 [00:15:48]
Um I don't know if sir, are you at all ready to proceed?

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:56]
Yes, ma'am.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:56]
I can start.

SPEAKER 3 [00:15:58]
Because I don't think that this is going to take longer than an hour and a half.

SPEAKER 4 [00:16:45]
Well, we can I I can start.

SPEAKER 4 [00:16:46]
There's no problem.

SPEAKER 4 [00:16:47]
I just felt that the evidence that was delivered was lengthy and I think in cross examination, it might be even longer in terms of responses.

SPEAKER 4 [00:16:57]
But I mean, if if if you are concerned with the wasted time, I am ready to start.

SPEAKER 3 [00:17:06]
You know, you see, when you you put it like that, um my thing is just when I think about the um evidence given, there was a lot of duplication with regards to the evidence given.

SPEAKER 3 [00:17:21]
But that was with the um when we consider the witness's answers.

SPEAKER 3 [00:17:32]
And that's why I'm saying there can't be that many questions, but if we consider

SPEAKER 3 [00:18:23]
um Miss, don't take offense, um the length of the answers that are given, it might not finish today and I I agree with you with regards to that.

SPEAKER 3 [00:18:38]
My my thing is just we are now at 2:30 almost and my concern is the fact that I'm going to get in trouble if we postpone the matter now.

SPEAKER 3 [00:18:50]
with all due respect and basically that is what my issue is because um they're going to say it's unnecessary postponement, but now we are are we still how many witnesses are we still intending to bring Miss Miss?

SPEAKER 1 [00:19:06]
Um Madam Commissioner, um I'm going to have to consult afterwards just to double check.

SPEAKER 1 [00:19:11]
but um I think because um Miss's testimony was so um lengthy and because I do think that that that we can just charge the case by that by just calling Mr. Theo Ozer regarding the leave if if if you should you require that obviously and then um perhaps just another witness to come and corroborate a couple of things she said when I certainly not all five all four witnesses and and Miss Miss anymore.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:24]
Okay.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:25]
Um. Can I just add as well?

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:27]
Madam Commissioner.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:27]
Yes.

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:28]
If you if you recall, on the last occasion, not the 15th, um that was on the 3rd of September, there was an agreement that the matter should be set down for consecutive dates on on the next occasion.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:41]
And it was

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:42]
strictly or

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:44]
directly because

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:45]
directly because of the situation we're in.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:46]
we're in for this.

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:47]
Yes.

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:47]
So, you know, on the 15th, when you were not available, the matter was set down for one day, we were not told why and today we've only got one day because you squeezed us in.

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:58]
So there there was that issue that was on the record that this matter needs at least two or three days consecutively to be able to get through the evidence and finish it within the time period allocated.

SPEAKER 4 [00:21:50]
So to have to start now, like I said Commissioner, I am prepared, but there is a valid um uh concern on on the cross examiner to leave a witness in the middle of of of cross examination.

SPEAKER 4 [00:22:03]
As much as the issues are separated, if I remember correctly, there is three different issues, I maybe I can cross examine her on one issue and be able to finish it within that one and a half hour.

SPEAKER 4 [00:22:15]
However, it's still an issue to leave the witness uh in the middle of of cross examination.

SPEAKER 3 [00:22:23]
I have another I see Miss has got a Yes.

SPEAKER 3 [00:22:26]
Yes, Missley.

SPEAKER 2 [00:22:27]
please give you an opportunity quickly. Sorry everyone.

SPEAKER 2 [00:22:30]
I I just Linda, I see you are referencing the next hour and a half, the session's booked till three.

SPEAKER 2 [00:22:37]
So I've made arrangements with my son to be picked up at half past three.

SPEAKER 2 [00:23:22]
So, um, we can start now with one topic if you wish, if we are going to finish by three, then that's fine with me.

SPEAKER 1 [00:23:32]
Madam Commissioner, I just don't like leaving a witness in, you know, under cross examination.

SPEAKER 1 [00:23:39]
And the case law that I have is

SPEAKER 3 [00:23:44]
Yeah, tell me something else.

SPEAKER 3 [00:23:46]
Um

SPEAKER 3 [00:23:48]
is there any possibility from your side that we can continue with the matter tomorrow?

SPEAKER 1 [00:23:56]
I'm at the C in Pretoria on a different matter on a constructive dismissal matter unfortunately Madam Commissioner.

SPEAKER 1 [00:24:04]
Also a party.

SPEAKER 3 [00:24:06]

SPEAKER 4 [00:24:14]
I can come and visit, but it will only be for three hours.

SPEAKER 3 [00:24:19]

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:03]
Okay, guys, let's do the following.

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:06]

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:12]
Okay.

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:13]
Go with dates.

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:14]

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:18]
Um if I can just go first, uh in the first week of November, I have three, five

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:26]
Okay, seven is a Friday.

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:27]
I think we all we all would like would like to exclude this.

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:31]
So on the first week I have three and five.

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:34]
And then um the following week, I have a week's trial.

SPEAKER 2 [00:26:44]
I would only be able to do three and five.

SPEAKER 2 [00:26:47]
um, in our previous down when we were postponing, I did let you guys know that I am not available from mid November.

SPEAKER 2 [00:26:55]
um, until mid Jan.

SPEAKER 2 [00:26:58]
So I will check if three and five um are fine with the witnesses.

SPEAKER 2 [00:27:03]
And then Madam Commissioner, I don't know how three and five is for you.

SPEAKER 3 [00:27:07]
Uh let's hear from Nady first.

SPEAKER 1 [00:27:10]
That is exactly what I wanted to say Madam Commissioner.

SPEAKER 1 [00:27:23]

So, um moet die Goed, so, um ja, want 1.1, wat sê dit?

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:07]
Moet die bogenoemde voltooi word, so my my oë is verskriklik.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:12]
Um, moet die bogenoemde projek nie voltooi word nie, kan dit beëindig word voor die beëindigingsdatum waarna verwys word deur die deel van beëindiging op so 'n vroeëre voltooiing.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:19]
Goed.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:20]
Hoe hoe verskil hierdie kontrak van haar haar um finale getekende kontrak?

SPEAKER 2 [00:00:27]
Uh, definieer in watter sin.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:29]
So die sleutel wat ek gesien het.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:32]
kontrak, kontrak.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:36]
Jammer, jy't gebreek daar.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:38]
Goed, die beperkte duur kontrak waaroor jy vroeër getuig het, ek dink dis ekstra 5.

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:44]
Um, onthou die beperkte duur kontrak wat sy aangegaan het um met betrekking tot hierdie presiese datum, die 30 April 2024?

SPEAKER 1 [00:00:52]
Het die klousule veel verskil van van daardie van daardie ooreenkoms?

SPEAKER 2 [00:00:58]
Um, dit het dieselfde klousules gehad wat aangedui het dat dit vir 'n beperkte tyd was, vir 'n beperkte, um, tydperk.

SPEAKER 2 [00:01:48]
Ek is nie seker ek verstaan nie um, ek is nie seker ek verstaan die vraag heeltemal nie, want hoe dit verskil het, was natuurlik dit was um 'n verandering aan ons KPI's.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:01]
Nee, as jy na paragraaf gaan, as jy dan afgaan na bladsy um as jy dan afgaan na bladsy 391,

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:08]

Ek sal net dubbelcheck.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:33]
Jammer.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:33]
Um ek wil net sien, hierdie bondel van my is baie vreemd.

SPEAKER 1 [00:02:37]
Hou aan, laat ek net teruggaan na die um 3319, jammer.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:23]

Goed, so um, hierdie is 'n um e-pos wat wat jy haar gestuur het oor 'n um herinnering.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:39]
Nou het jy vroeër getuig oor die herinnering e-posse wat jy haar moes stuur.

SPEAKER 1 [00:03:43]
Kan jy net vir die kommissaris vertel wat die relevansie hiervan is, asseblief?

SPEAKER 2 [00:03:46]
So dit was net weer om haar te herinner dat dit is wat ooreengekom is.

SPEAKER 2 [00:03:52]
Um, onthou ook op hierdie stadium is ons nog in besprekings met ons kliënt oor of ons met hulle sou voortgaan, of ons nog deur 'n bouproses sou gaan.

SPEAKER 2 [00:04:02]
So op daardie stadium kan ek niemand 'n soort van 'n aanwysing of hoop gee dat daar enigiets sou wees wat dalk sou gebeur nie, alhoewel ons nog um deur 'n proses gegaan het sonder kliënt.

SPEAKER 1 [00:04:16]
Dankie.

SPEAKER 1 [00:04:17]
En dan kan ons asseblief aanbeweeg na bladsy 320?

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:11]
Uh, dit is die aansoekers.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:16]
Vir watter maand?

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:18]
Uh.

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:22]
Die vir Mei, Mei 2024.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:31]
Goed, kan jy asseblief net um aan die kommissaris verduidelik hoe haar reistoelae vir hierdie maand, vir hierdie maande gewerk het.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:39]
Vir vir vir Mei, jammer vir Mei.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:41]
Kan jy asseblief net addisionele reis lees, net in die rekord lees wat dit langs addisionele reis sê.

SPEAKER 1 [00:05:45]
Jammer, addisionele reis, dit sê.

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:49]
Goed, so vir die addisionele reis sê dit April, Mei en Junie.

SPEAKER 2 [00:05:52]
So wat gebeur het met ons nuwe ooreenkoms met ons kliënt, hulle het ingestem om 'n addisionele um 'n brandstof toelae te betaal gebaseer op die indiening van logboeke en en dat dit gebruik moes word as 'n werk as 'n werksinstrument.

SPEAKER 2 [00:06:47]
Um, waartoe ons hulle gekry het om in te stem, was om dit terug te dateer om van April af te begin.

SPEAKER 2 [00:06:53]
So aanvanklik al het hulle nie gewerk in uh sy het nie noodwendig daarvoor gewerk in April, Mei en Mei voor hierdie punt nie, het ons kliënt ingestem om dit terug te dateer net om hulle 'n bietjie van 'n bietjie ekstra geld te gee.

SPEAKER 1 [00:07:10]
Goed, kan jy net vir die kommissaris verduidelik hoe hierdie brandstofverdeling gewerk het in terme van die addisionele brandstof wat nou betaal is en wat was die ooreengekome brandstof?

SPEAKER 2 [00:07:17]
Dit was so so die ooreengekome was die 3 000 soos hierbo vermeld, um op dieselfde en dan as jy gaan um na onder vir die vir April, Mei, Junie, hoe dit twee sou wees, sou dit 2 000 rand addisioneel elke maand wees.

SPEAKER 2 [00:07:35]
Weereens, mits ons al die korrekte dokumentasie aan hulle gestuur het.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:20]
Reg.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:24]
Jammer, jy't gebreek daar en die en die addisionele was?

SPEAKER 2 [00:08:27]
Die addisionele is dit so dit dek drie maande, April, Mei en Junie, so dit sou beteken dat dit 2 000 rand per maand sou wees.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:36]
Goed.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:37]
Dan um, kan jy asseblief net na bladsy 321 beweeg, asseblief?

SPEAKER 2 [00:08:43]
Um ja, ek is hier.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:45]
Goed, en kan jy asseblief verduidelik uh vertel ons net wat wat die datum is vir hierdie dokument?

SPEAKER 2 [00:08:50]
Um so hierdie is vir Junie.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:53]
Goed, en dan as jy gaan na reistoelae, vas en koste.

SPEAKER 1 [00:08:57]
Kan jy aan die kommissaris verduidelik hoekom, want soos ek verstaan, sy was 'n sy was sy sou die 3 000 kry en dan sou sy 'n addisionele 2 000 daarby kry, is dit korrek?

SPEAKER 2 [00:09:06]
Ja.

SPEAKER 2 [00:09:07]
So as jy boontoe gaan na die vorige wat in Mei was, sal jy sien dat ons dit reeds vir Junie betaal het.

SPEAKER 1 [00:09:16]
Goed.

SPEAKER 1 [00:09:17]
So is dit wat sy net 3 000 vir daardie maand gekry het, nie 5 000 nie?

SPEAKER 2 [00:10:01]
Dit is korrek.

SPEAKER 1 [00:10:03]
Goed.

SPEAKER 1 [00:10:04]
Kan en um Goed, dankie.

SPEAKER 1 [00:10:08]
Dit sal uh getuienis in hoof wees.

SPEAKER 1 [00:10:10]
Dankie, Mevrou Kommissaris.

SPEAKER 2 [00:10:13]
Dankie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:10:44]
Uh jammer, ek het 'n baie wonderlike gesprek met myself.

SPEAKER 3 [00:10:47]
Ek was gedemp.

SPEAKER 3 [00:10:49]
Goed.

SPEAKER 3 [00:10:50]
Um Meneer, het u 'n paar minute nodig?

SPEAKER 4 [00:10:55]
Um, ja, Mevrou Kommissaris, as u my net tot 2 uur kan gee.

SPEAKER 3 [00:11:41]
Goed, perfek.

SPEAKER 4 [00:11:42]
Ek wil net almal in die prentjie plaas.

SPEAKER 4 [00:11:45]
Ek is in bespreking met die kliënt of ons die kruisondervraging vandag moet hervat, aangesien dit na 1 uur is, want ek dink nie ek sal haar getuienis vandag kan voltooi nie, maar ek wil net instruksies van my kliënt daaroor neem en terugkom en vir u 'n behoorlike adres oor daardie kwessie gee.

SPEAKER 1 [00:12:05]
Dankie baie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:07]
Goed.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:08]
Um wat ek kan vra terwyl julle bespreek, um kan julle asseblief weer na datums kyk.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:19]
Um laat ek net kyk.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:22]
Ek is beskikbaar.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:25]
Laat ek net sien.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:27]
Um ek doen êrens opleiding.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:32]
Laat ek net kyk.

SPEAKER 3 [00:12:34]
Um wag 'n oomblik.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:24]
Ek kan vir u sê watter datums ek nie beskikbaar is nie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:34]
Goed, wag.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:34]
Ek doen opleiding op die 20ste en die 21ste November.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:42]
Goed?

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:43]
So ek is nie dan beskikbaar nie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:46]
Maar die meeste van die ander dae is ek beskikbaar.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:49]
Ek dink nie ek gaan iets doen nie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:13:54]
So as julle solank julle dagboeke kan nagaan en dan dalk, ek weet nie of julle nog in November beskikbaar sal wees nie of dan sal ons dit vroeg um Desember moet doen voordat ek met verlof gaan.

SPEAKER 3 [00:14:10]
So kyk asseblief in julle dagboeke, um en dan kan ons ook van daar af gaan.

SPEAKER 4 [00:14:18]
Geneem, mevrou. Dankie.

SPEAKER 2 [00:15:00]
Dankie baie.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:06]
Ek wil nie hierdie getuienis begin en dit in die middel los nie.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:11]
Want dit gee haar 'n kans om te gaan en uit te vind wat aangaan.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:18]
En ek verstaan wat u sê soos ja, maar ek gaan beslis nie klaarmaak nie.

SPEAKER 1 [00:15:25]
Goed.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:26]
En ek wil 'n getuie een dag hou.

SPEAKER 3 [00:15:37]
Yo ouens, ek is net ek is bekommerd oor die partye met betrekking tot die um vermorste tyd en vermorste koste met betrekking tot hierdie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:15:48]
Um ek weet nie of meneer, is u enigsins gereed om voort te gaan nie?

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:56]
Ja, mevrou.

SPEAKER 4 [00:15:56]
Ek kan begin.

SPEAKER 3 [00:15:58]
Want ek dink nie dit gaan langer as 'n uur en 'n half neem nie.

SPEAKER 4 [00:16:45]
Wel, ons kan ek kan begin.

SPEAKER 4 [00:16:46]
Daar is geen probleem nie.

SPEAKER 4 [00:16:47]
Ek het net gevoel dat die gelewerde getuienis lank was en ek dink in kruisondervraging, dit mag selfs langer wees in terme van antwoorde.

SPEAKER 4 [00:16:57]
Maar ek bedoel, as as as u bekommerd is oor die vermorste tyd, is ek gereed om te begin.

SPEAKER 3 [00:17:06]
Weet u, u sien, as u dit so stel, um my ding is net as ek dink aan die um getuienis wat gegee is, was daar baie duplisering met betrekking tot die getuienis wat gegee is.

SPEAKER 3 [00:17:21]
Maar dit was met die um wanneer ons die getuie se antwoorde oorweeg.

SPEAKER 3 [00:17:32]
En daarom sê ek daar kan nie so baie vrae wees nie, maar as ons oorweeg

SPEAKER 3 [00:18:23]
um Mevrou, moenie aanstoot neem nie, um die lengte van die antwoorde wat gegee word, dit mag dalk nie vandag klaarmaak nie en ek stem met u saam met betrekking tot dit.

SPEAKER 3 [00:18:38]
My my ding is net ons is nou by bykans 2:30 en my kommer is die feit dat ek in die moeilikheid gaan kom as ons die saak nou uitstel.

SPEAKER 3 [00:18:50]
met alle respek en basies dit is wat my kwessie is, want um hulle gaan sê dis onnodige uitstel, maar nou is ons, hoeveel getuies is ons nog van plan om te bring Mevrou Mevrou?

SPEAKER 1 [00:19:06]
Um Mevrou Kommissaris, um ek sal daarna moet konsulteer om net dubbel te kontroleer.

SPEAKER 1 [00:19:11]
maar um ek dink omdat um Mevrou se getuienis so um lank was en omdat ek wel dink dat dat ons die saak net kan beslis deur net mnr. Theo Ozer te roep oor die verlof as as as u dit benodig natuurlik en dan um dalk net nog 'n getuie om 'n paar dinge te kom bevestig wat sy gesê het, beslis nie al vyf al vier getuies en en Mevrou Mevrou meer nie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:24]
Goed.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:25]
Um. Kan ek ook net byvoeg?

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:27]
Mevrou Kommissaris.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:27]
Ja.

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:28]
As u as u onthou, by die laaste geleentheid, nie die 15de nie, um dit was op 3 September, was daar 'n ooreenkoms dat die saak vir opeenvolgende datums op die volgende geleentheid vasgestel moet word.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:41]
En dit was

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:42]
streng of

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:44]
direk omdat

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:45]
direk as gevolg van die situasie waarin ons verkeer.

SPEAKER 3 [00:20:46]
ons is in hiervoor.

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:47]
Ja.

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:47]
So, u weet, op die 15de, toe u nie beskikbaar was nie, is die saak vir een dag vasgestel, ons is nie vertel hoekom nie en vandag het ons net een dag omdat u ons ingepas het.

SPEAKER 4 [00:20:58]
So daar was daardie kwessie wat op rekord was dat hierdie saak ten minste twee of drie dae agtereenvolgens benodig om deur die getuienis te kom en dit binne die toegewese tydperk te voltooi.

SPEAKER 4 [00:21:50]
So om nou te moet begin, soos ek Kommissaris gesê het, ek is voorbereid, maar daar is 'n geldige um uh kommer by die kruisondervraer om 'n getuie in die middel van van van kruisondervraging te laat.

SPEAKER 4 [00:22:03]
Hoeveel die kwessies ook al geskei is, as ek reg onthou, is daar drie verskillende kwessies, ek kan haar dalk kruisondervra oor een kwessie en dit binne daardie een en 'n half uur kan voltooi.

SPEAKER 4 [00:22:15]
Dit is egter steeds 'n kwessie om die getuie uh in die middel van van kruisondervraging te laat.

SPEAKER 3 [00:22:23]
Ek het nog 'n ek sien Mevrou het 'n Ja.

SPEAKER 3 [00:22:26]
Ja, Mevrou.

SPEAKER 2 [00:22:27]
gee asseblief vinnig 'n geleentheid. Jammer almal.

SPEAKER 2 [00:22:30]
Ek ek net Linda, ek sien jy verwys na die volgende uur en 'n half, die sessie is bespreek tot drie.

SPEAKER 2 [00:22:37]
So ek het reëlings getref met my seun om om half drie opgelaai te word.

SPEAKER 2 [00:23:22]
So, um, ons kan nou begin met een onderwerp as u wil, as ons teen drie klaar is, dan is dit vir my reg.

SPEAKER 1 [00:23:32]
Mevrou Kommissaris, ek hou net nie daarvan om 'n getuie te los, u weet, onder kruisondervraging nie.

SPEAKER 1 [00:23:39]
En die regsake wat ek het, is

SPEAKER 3 [00:23:44]
Ja, sê vir my iets anders.

SPEAKER 3 [00:23:46]
Um

SPEAKER 3 [00:23:48]
is daar enige moontlikheid van u kant dat ons die saak môre kan voortsit?

SPEAKER 1 [00:23:56]
Ek is ongelukkig by die KPR in Pretoria oor 'n ander saak oor 'n konstruktiewe ontslag kwessie, Mevrou Kommissaris.

SPEAKER 1 [00:24:04]
Ook 'n party.

SPEAKER 3 [00:24:06]
Jammer, mevrou.

SPEAKER 4 [00:24:08]
Ek het 'n arbitrasie om 1 uur in Johannesburg.

SPEAKER 3 [00:24:12]
Goed, so u kan my kom besoek.

SPEAKER 4 [00:24:14]
Ek kan kom besoek, maar dit sal net vir drie uur wees.

SPEAKER 3 [00:24:19]
Um, Goed, yo, ek kyk net.

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:03]
Goed ouens, kom ons doen die volgende.

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:06]
Um laat ons sien, laat ons sien, laat ons sien.

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:12]
Goed.

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:13]
Gaan met datums.

SPEAKER 3 [00:25:14]
Kan ons ten minste oor datums ooreenkom?

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:18]
Um as ek net eerste kan gaan, uh in die eerste week van November, ek het drie, vyf

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:26]
Goed, sewe is 'n Vrydag.

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:27]
Ek dink ons almal sou graag hierdie wou uitsluit.

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:31]
So in die eerste week het ek drie en vyf.

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:34]
En dan um die volgende week, ek het 'n week se verhoor.

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:38]
My volgende datum is 17, 18 en 19.

SPEAKER 4 [00:25:42]
en dan in die week van die 24ste, het ek 24, 25, 26 en 27.

SPEAKER 2 [00:25:52]
Goed Mevrou Kommissaris, so jammer.

SPEAKER 2 [00:25:55]
Um, goed, uh jammer as ek eerste kan gaan.

SPEAKER 2 [00:25:58]
So van die datum wat dit lyk en ek moet dit nog bevestig, want ons moet met die getuies kyk.

SPEAKER 2 [00:26:44]
Ek sal net drie en vyf kan doen.

SPEAKER 2 [00:26:47]
um, in ons vorige uitstel toe ons uitgestel het, het ek julle laat weet dat ek nie beskikbaar is van middel November nie.

SPEAKER 2 [00:26:55]
um, tot middel Januarie.

SPEAKER 2 [00:26:58]
So ek sal kyk of drie en vyf um reg is met die getuies.

SPEAKER 2 [00:27:03]
En dan Mevrou Kommissaris, ek weet nie hoe drie en vyf vir u is nie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:27:07]
Uh laat ons eers van Nady hoor.

SPEAKER 1 [00:27:10]
Dit is presies wat ek wou sê Mevrou Kommissaris.

SPEAKER 1 [00:27:12]
my instruksie was dat ek feitlik van die 1ste tot die 9de November, want um Mevrou neem effektief verlof vanaf die 11de November tot um middel Januarie.

SPEAKER 1 [00:27:23]
So ek sou ook sê drie en vyf is die enigste datums wat saamval met um mnr. Lamini se um voorstelle Mevrou Kommissaris.

SPEAKER 1 [00:27:30]
Ek sou net bevestig. Jammer.

SPEAKER 3 [00:27:33]
Ek is ook vry op daardie twee dae.

SPEAKER 3 [00:27:37]
Ek kyk net iets na.

SPEAKER 3 [00:27:39]
Drie is vir my reg.

SPEAKER 3 [00:28:24]
Um

SPEAKER 3 [00:28:32]
Laat ek net hier kyk.

SPEAKER 3 [00:28:36]
en hierdie saak is nie gerapporteer nie.

SPEAKER 3 [00:28:39]
Um

SPEAKER 3 [00:28:56]
Gee my net een sekonde.

SPEAKER 3 [00:28:58]
Ek kyk net iets na.

SPEAKER 3 [00:30:05]
Goed, ek kan drie en vyf doen.

SPEAKER 2 [00:30:11]
Goed, perfek. Mevrou Kommissaris, sal u ons net um tyd gee om seker te maak dat dit reg is met ons getuies?

SPEAKER 3 [00:30:18]
Kan ek u nou tyd gee, want ek wil hê ons moet die datums kry.

SPEAKER 2 [00:30:23]
Goed, so so net om u in te lig, is uh gekontrakteer aan ons, 'n derde party, so ek kan nie 'n direkte werknemer is nie, so ek kan nie 'n besluit neem en sê dat hy beskikbaar is nie.

SPEAKER 2 [00:30:35]
um so ek sou hom moes kontak en sê um en uitvind.

SPEAKER 2 [00:30:40]
Ek het hom 'n bietjie vroeër gekontak um om met hom te bespreek, maar hy het my laat weet dat hy my 'n bietjie later sal kontak omdat hy in 'n vergadering is.

SPEAKER 2 [00:30:48]
So ek sal ek kan hom weer probeer kontak nou.

SPEAKER 3 [00:30:52]
Kyk of jy hom in die hande kan kry.

SPEAKER 2 [00:30:55]
afhanklik.

SPEAKER 3 [00:30:56]
Um goed, gee my 'n minuut. Ja.

SPEAKER 3 [00:30:57]
Kyk of jy hom in die hande kan kry.

SPEAKER 2 [00:30:59]
Goed.
